# many-body-simulation
a simulation of many different planets interacting according to Newton's description of gravity. the three-body problem is famously unsolvable analytically and requires simulating. I have extended the three body problem to simulate as many planets as your computer can handle, with random values. 

Requires Python with pygame package to run. 

Set the number of planets you want to simulate by changing the variable 'numplanets' to an integer of the number of planets you want. 

If you want the planets to leave a trail behind to paint a pretty picture you can do so by setting 'Tracer' variable to True.

If you want to change the number of stars on the background you can do so by setting variable 'numstars' to an integer of the number of stars you want.
